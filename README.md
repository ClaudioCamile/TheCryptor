The Art of the Silent Fist almost landed me in despair - I felt, sometime ago I had this test, I'v got there unprepered and very tired, from many point of view it would be better to stay back and wait, but back wind pushed me ahead, I have failed, defeated I failed up the alley, trying to fix the twisted, time will tell its own - I knew, now it remains to mend the rifts.
